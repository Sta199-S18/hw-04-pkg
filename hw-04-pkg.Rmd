### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages-data, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(lubridate)
bike <- read_csv("data/bikeshare-day.csv")

bike <- bike %>%
  mutate(month = month(dteday))

bike %>% 
  count(season, month)

ggplot(bike, aes(x = factor(season), y = cnt)) + geom_boxplot()
```


### Question 1 - Which package are you using? 

State the name of the package, whether it was on CRAN or GitHub, and include the code for loading it.

```{r load-package, message=FALSE}

```

### Question 2 - What are you doing with the package? 

Give me a brief narrative including code and output.
